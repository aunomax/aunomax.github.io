Here and henceforth, $T_{max}$ denotes the maximal time of the existence of the solution, and $|\cdot|_p$ is the standard $L_p$ norm Deduction differentiating (1.4) with respect to time gives Similarity At this stage, we can reproduce the argument of [20]. The proof is done along a similar line, but estimates near the boundary are more crucial.</description></item></channel></rss>
